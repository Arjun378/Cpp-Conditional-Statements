## Introduction to Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on specific conditions. You can execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. This repository covers the fundamentals of conditional statements in C++.

## If Statements

Learn how to use `if` statements to execute code blocks when a condition is true. Explore `if-else` statements, nested `if` statements, and `else-if` chains.

## Switch Statements

Discover `switch` statements, a powerful tool for handling multiple conditions in a structured way. Learn how to use `case` labels and `default` to manage various scenarios.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator (`? :`) is a concise way to write conditional statements. Explore its syntax and use cases.

## Logical Operators

Understand the logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) used to combine conditions. Learn how to create complex conditions and improve code readability.
